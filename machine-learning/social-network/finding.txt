   the value you computed) for each of the following centrality measures:

A) Degree Centrality:
407 - momtobedby8.com

3. Please describe your process for identifying these centrality measures.
   (e.g., What software did you use?, What functions?, etc.)

I used R, using the "centralization.degree, closeness, and betweenness"
functions. I also used the "which.max" function to find where the max was.

4. Please describe anything else you learned or did for this assignment (i.e.,
   above and beyond requirements)

I just did the requirements.

5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

D

6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I just completed the requirements, nothing special.
