1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many
different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained,
and what were the parameters that produced it?

The highest accuracy that I obtained was around: 96.27%
The values that I used were 1500 for the cost, and .001 for gamma.
I tried like 7 or so different parameters, changing gamma as well as the cost.

2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many
different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained,
and what were the parameters that produced it?

The highest accuracy I obtained was around: 90.28%
My gamma was .001 and my cost was 750
I tried around seven or so, the higher cost values were doing worse, so I kept
it at 750.

3. Please describe your experiment/results for the Abalone dataset. How many
different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained,
and what were the parameters that produced it?

One problem I had was that I wasn't rounding my output values, so I would get a
0% accuracy every time.

One I fixed that, my highest accuracy was about: 29.02%
My parameters were .01 for gamma and 1900 for cost.

4. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard
requirements.

Nothing.

5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but signficantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

C

6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I couldn't get above 29% with the abalone. Though my results were close.
