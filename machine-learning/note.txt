Two popular distances are:
Euclidean Distance and Manhattan distance

Valid distance metrics must hold:
	1. Non-negativivity.
	2. The identity property.
		If two things are the same, the distance must be 0.
	3. Symmetry. d(x,y) = d(y,x)
	4. Triangle inequality. d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)

Beware of what biases you are introducing to an algorithm based on your
assumptions you are making with your data.

What is an algorithm that figures out terrorists is accurate 99.9% of the time?
	return false.

To figure out the accuracy, add all the numbers correct on top of the division,
then all of the numbers are on the bottom of the division.

To calculate error,
	output = sigmoid( summation( weight_ij * input_ij ) )

	delta or error, that is the name of this next one.
	for output nodes
	delta = output * (1 - output) * (output - what_it_should_have_been)

	There is a different delta formula for the hidden nodes.

	new_weight = weight - learning_rate * delta * input

	sigmoid * (1 - sigmoid) * [summation of weight and deltas]
