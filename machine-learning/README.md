# iris-machine-learning
For my machine learning course.

Each folder contains a different machine learning algorithm. List of algorithms
and descriptions in chronological order, below:

nearest-neighbor -> First one, no normalization, parsed only numbers.
decision-tree    -> Second one, no normalization, parsed discretized values.
neural-network   -> Third one, work in progress. Z-Score normalization, Takes
                    in numerical inputs and discrete classes.
