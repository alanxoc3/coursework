# Pygame Competition
## What is Pygame?

Check out [this](http://www.pygame.org/lofi.html) page. Pygame is a Python
library that helps you make 2-D games. Pygame is relatively easy, but it
doesn't do everything for you. Pygame isn't really used to put games into
production, but it is great for making a quick prototype, then making the
complete game in another language.

## Rules
The topic is to create a video game about Outer Space. The minimum requirements
is that the program runs without errors.

The competition will end when Code Space starts on February 15th.

## Steps to Video Game Creation
There are no steps, but here are a few helpful guidelines:

* Don't over plan. Especially for this small competition, try to complete as simple of a game as you can.

* Get some free game art, like from [open game art](http://opengameart.org/).  They have free music and sprites/images.

* It is easiest to install Pygame on a Windows or Linux computer. Macs are apparently tricky to figure out.

* Go through a Pygame tutorial or two. [Here](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2010/09/01/the-top-10-pygame-tutorials/) is a list of good ones.

* Look at and use some examples. There are bunch of good ones [here](https://github.com/Mekire/pygame-samples), all written in Python 2.
