# Inquisitiveness Exploration
This is a testing program for various sorting algorithms.

Sorts included are insertion, bucket, quick, tim, bubble, cocktail shaker.

The testing file is: *test_algs.cpp*

One needs to only compile that file (with a c++11 compiler) in order to run various tests. Only the standard library is used to implement the sorts.

The -p option is used if you want to pipe in the input with another command.

These are the other command/options you may use to configure your output:

-p         - used for piping
tim        - tim sort
quick      - quick sort
insertion  - insertion sort
cocktail   - cocktail shaker sort
bucket     - bucket sort
bubble     - bubble sort
