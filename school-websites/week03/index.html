		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the homepage of PSC. PSC is an acronym for the <q>Pencil Sharpening Company.</q> Have you ever wondered why mechanical pencils have been taking dominance in the world over the past 15 years? The founder of our company has as well. Alan Morgan grew up for most of his lifetime in the 21st century and has witnessed the change from standard wooden No. 2 pencils to mechanical pencils during his educational career. Alan remained a strict wooden pencil user while those around him became infected by the <q>Mechanical Pencil Fever</q> (MPF). Because of his sheer love for standard pencils, he has started a company to assist others in converting, re-converting, or sticking to wooden pencils. To navigate this page, look to the right and click on a tab. The <q>About</q> tab contains more about what this company does to assist its fellow wooden scribes. Also, check out the <q>Controversy</q> tab as well as the <q>Opportunity</q> tab.</p>
