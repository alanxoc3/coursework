		<h1>Opportunity</h1>
		<p>Here at PSC, we love to <span id="emphasize">hire people.</span> Our company is booming, we have unlimited resources and a very large amount of consumers. If you want to work for us, email us at <a href="mailto:alanxoc3@gmail.com">alanxoc3@gmail.com</a></p>
		<p>When you get a job, expect lots of training all about the art of sharpening pencils from sharpening with a knife to a simple hand sharpener, to electric sharpeners. We tend to avoid using electric sharpeners, because that means that the machine is in control instead of the human. As an employee, you would get great benefits including insurance on paper cuts and 1 free pencil a week. We would love to have you.</p>
