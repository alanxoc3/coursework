		<h1>Controversy</h1>
		<p>Many people wonder if there truly is need for a pencil sharpening company. Well there is. There are people trying to use regular pencils, who just can't sharpen it to a perfect point. Here at the PSC, we cannot bear the thought of a normal pencil enthusiast writing with a dull pencil. With the increase of pens, mechanical pencils, bamboo tablets, paintbrushes, styluses, keyboards, typewriters, etc... real, genuine pencils are becoming scarce. These people need our help. Others may not fully comprehend the service that we render to people in need. We urge everyone to convert to normal pencils. You can order some online from us right now. Email us your credit card information and we will send you twenty-three pre-sharpened pencils for only $10. See the "About" page for the email.</p>

		<p>One of our products, the <q>Anti Mechanical Pencil Shirt</q> has gotten a lot of bad rep in the news as of late. We at the <q>PSC</q> will stand firm with our standards though!</p>
