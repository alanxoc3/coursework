		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Welcome to PSC. PSC is an acronym for the <q>Pencil Sharpening Company.</q> Have you ever wondered why mechanical pencils have been taking dominance in the world's market over the past 15 years? The founder of our company has as well. Alan Morgan grew up for most of his lifetime in the 21st century and has witnessed the change from standard wooden No. 2 pencils to it's mechanical look alike during his educational career. Alan remained a strict wooden pencil user while those around him became infected by the <q>Mechanical Pencil Fever</q> (MPF). Because of his sheer love for standard pencils, he has started a company to assist others in converting, re-converting, or sticking to wooden pencils.</p>
		<p>What does this company provide for others? Have you ever tried sharpening your pencil and find that the tip of the pencil is broken? Well we have. Professional pencil sharpening is one of the many services that we offer here at PSC. Not everyone can sharpen a perfect pencil. Normally we charge a low fee of 50 cents per perfect sharpen.</p>
