	<h3 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Everyone who lives on the planet earth will ask themselves some questions at one point or another, such as:</p>
   <ul style="list-style-type:square">
   	<li><a href="#WHO">Who am I?</a></li>
   	<li><a href="#HERE">Why am I here?</a></li>
   	<li><a href="#GOING">Where am I going?</a></li>
   </ul>
	<p>This HTML document does not intend to answer those questions for everyone. In fact those questions will only be answered for me, so that people coming to this <q>About Me</q> page may actually know a thing or two about me. To begin I will share my three favorite quotes, which I believe sum up my ideals:</p>
	<blockquote style="font-family:serif">
	The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight,
	but they, while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night.
	--George Bernard Shaw, <i>Irish Playwright.</i>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote style="font-family:serif">
	Somebody said that it couldn't be done,
	but he with a chuckle replied,
	that maybe it couldn't, but he would be one,
	who wouldn't say so 'till he tried.
	So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin,
	on his face if he worried he hid it.
	He started to sing as he tackled the thing,
	that couldn't be done and he did it.

	Somebody scoffed, "Oh, you'll never do that,
	at least no one has done it."
	But he took off his coat and took off his hat,
	and the first thing we knew, he'd begun it.
	With a lift of the chin and a bit of a grin,
	without any doubting or quiddit.
	He started to sing as he tackled the thing,
	that couldn't be done and he did it.

	There are thousands to tell you, it cannot be done.
	There are thousands to prophesy failure.
	There are thousands to point out to you one by one,
	the dangers that wait to assail you.
	But just buckle right in with a bit of a grin,
	just take off your coat and go to it.
	Just start to sing as you tackle the thing,
	that couldn't be done and you'll do it.
	--Edgar A. Guest, <i>American Poet.</i>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote style="font-family:serif">
	There is no chance, no destiny, no fate,
	can circumvent, or hinder, or control
	the firm resolve of a <strong>determined</strong> soul.
	--Ella Wheeler Wilcox, <i>American Poet.</i>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Who am I?</h3>
	<p>You know my name and guessing is a game. I am Alan Morgan from California, Utah, Idaho, Virginia, and Alabama. I have been around the block a couple times. At the time of this web page creation, I am attending <q>Brigham Young University Idaho</q> (<abbr title="Brigham Young University Idaho">BYUi</abbr>). I majoring in the art of computer science. One could debate that computer science is not an art, but I claim that claim to be invalid! Any time a person creates "something", that person has contributed to the world of art. Speaking of art, I also many hobbies including practicing piano and creating pixel art. Though I am still an amatuer, I aspire to be like <a href="http://www.videogamepianist.com/">this pianist</a> and I own a pixel art blog <a href="http://awesometures.blogspot.com/">here</a>. Back to computer science, this statement describes me well:</p>

<pre style="font-family:monospace;">
#include <iostream>

int main (int argc, char ** argv) {
	std::cout << "Hello World..." << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
</pre>

	<p>I love c++. Along with computer programming as my major, it is also my passion. I spend my free time wasting away creating programs from simple games to personal console programs.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Why am I here?</h3>
	<p>I am here to to be a good person. I am a Christian and strive to live like one. I thrive off of helping other people. If I am feeling down, I try to find <i>something</i> to do for <i>someone</i>. Not only am I here to help others, but I am here to serve my savior.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Where am I going?</h3>
	<p>By the time you (the client) reads this web page, I may be going home, to work, to school, to the grave, or (embarrassingly) the restroom. Oh, you wanted to know where I am going in life. Through the course of my life, I am always trying to reach my goals. I have hinted at some of these goals in the previous sections about piano and pixel art. What you may not know about me is that I am big into open source programming and I would kill (figuratively) to be a kernel developer for the Linux Operating System. Okay now, if you want to follow me literally, here is my schedule for the next couple months:</p>
